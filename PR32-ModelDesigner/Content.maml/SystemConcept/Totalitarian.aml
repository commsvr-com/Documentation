      In this topic we analyze if using one universal, “all in one” product dedicated to integrating manufacturing management.

        <para>One option to overcome the communication chaos problem is to use an “all in one” product dedicated to integrating manufacturing management. Usually, it is provided as one complex, total system – let’s call it a suppersystem. Most of the MES (Manufacturing Execution System) vendors offer theirs products as a panacea for all problems of the chaotic system integration. In fact, they provide a centralized processing system using adapted off-the-shelf products instead of realizing integration functions and providing a solution that allows for flexible management of process data.</para>
        <para>Of course, this strategy is beneficial to vendors but it could be very dangerous for the users.</para>

        <para>Implementation of a certain management platform is not a short term task. In view of many years of operation we have to face up to the following consequences of any supersystem application:</para>
        <list class="ordered">
          <listItem>
            <para>High starting expenses –applying of a supersystem is not a cheap solution. Only software price may seem attractive but unavoidable engineering and implementing costs could be very high.</para>
          </listItem>
          <listItem>
            <para>Loss of the previous investments– this approach usually requires that many of the existing systems are removed, which means wasting of investment founds.</para>
          </listItem>
          <listItem>
            <para>Monopolization of the provider’s role – on the free market, customers have a privileged position, because generally they can select products and, as a consequence, vendors. But in the case of supersystems engagement it is a one way route - it is extremely difficult to abandon the selection. In other words, it means that customers lose their initial strong position and, thus, maintenance and development prices might be raised.</para>
          </listItem>
          <listItem>
            <para>Does the supersystem really exist? – The supersystems offer very reach functionalities and meet almost everyone’s expectations. But the word “almost” in the previous sentence can make a real difference. Because it is practically impossible to provide a fully universal system, there is a risk that we should have to modify the problem so that it could be solved by the utilized system.</para>
          </listItem>
          <listItem>
            <para>Withdrawal from the market - there is clear evidence that even reputable vendors cease to provide whole groups of products over night. As a consequence, they usually do not provide development and support services any more causing many troubles with keeping the system running.</para>

        <linkAlternateText>The article addresses system integration methodologies and a new Process Observer concept, which is like a bridge connection between the plant-floor, process and business management levels. It discusses at length the main features of robust data exchange in an enterprise, i.e. three-level redundancy, multi-communication capabilities and optimization methods.</linkAlternateText>
